<a name="intro"/> <h2> Intro </h2> </a>
- This project was an introduction to c++ and OOP concpets
- The project contains 8 mini projects each one with a new topic.
- A lot of interesting concepts and a new Langague after learning C, was nice to see that with a good base in a langague other langagues are not so hard to understand. They are not easy, but with a base it is possible to learn other langagues.
- This project uses C++98 flag.

- CPP 02: This module is designed to understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP.
- CPP 03: This module is designed to understand Inheritance in CPP.
- CPP 04: This module is designed to understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP.
- CPP 05: This module is designed to understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in CPP.
- CPP 06: This module is designed to understand the different casts in CPP.

```
- to delete all obj (.o) files created
```bash
make clean
```
 - to delete all created files
```bash
make fclean
```

```bash
make re
```
- to run the exercise type ./"name of the file create by make command"
```bash
./
```
